## Below are mobs that can be spawned in by anyone
## A mob can only be spawned in 1 at a time and you will have a cooldown timer
## If another viewer spawns in a mob and you try to spawn in one as well, you will have to wait until the mob has spawned to send your spawn command
## Mobs spawned in will spawn after 10 seconds and a timer will display in game in the ActionBar to warn Latch
## Example: If you want to spawn a Giant, you would type '|spawn giant' in the chat
