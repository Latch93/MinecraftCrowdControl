## Below are hostile mobs that can be spawned in by Ranked Members or by donation
## If you are a Ranked Member, you can spawn these mobs in Twitch chat, but you will have to wait on your cooldown timer
## If you donate money to spawn in one of these mobs, then the mob will spawn without warning to Latch and does not affect your cooldown timer
## In order to spawn a mob by donation, the donation amount must be the specific amount listed below for the mob you want to spawn
## Example Donation: If you want to spawn a creeper with a donation, you would donate $1.50 USD
## Example Spawn command in Twitch Chat: |spawn creeper
